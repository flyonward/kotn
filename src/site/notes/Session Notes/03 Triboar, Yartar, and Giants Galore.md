### Giant Castle on a Cloud
The Party meets with [[Characters/Zephyros\|Zephyros]] in his home, the [[Places/Giant Castle On A Cloud\|Giant Castle On A Cloud]]. [[Characters/Zephyros\|Zephyros]] speaks of a prophecy of destruction and chaos, the Party agrees to travel to [[Places/Triboar\|Triboar]] on the Castle Cloud. The Party also obtains some information about Giants and their societal system:

> [!info]+ The Caste System of Giants, as defined by the Ordning
> Giants follow a hierarchical system, in descending order:
> 1. Annam, the All-Father (a god)
> 2. Storm Giants
> 3. Cloud Giants
> 4. Fire Giants, known to be volatile and warmongers
> 5. Frost Giants, known to be predatory and for thheir partial prowess
> 6. Stone Giants, known to be xenophobic
> 7. Hill Giants, widely known as gluttonous dullards

> - Giants are widely regarded as enemies of dragons
> - Mortals stopped the rise of the dragon queen
> - The caste system was shattered, leading to giants at war with one another as they compete for the top spot
> - The last great giant empire was Ostoria

### Triboar
The Party arrives in [[Places/Triboar\|Triboar]], a large bustling mercantile town. Beltane notes of an untouched forest outside of town named [[Places/POIs/Gwaeron's Slumber\|Gwaeron's Slumber]]. It is said that worshippers of Gwaeron, God of Tracking, or Mieliki, Goddess of the Forest, would receive prophetic dreams if they slept there. For the night, [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] , Pitch, and Caine head to [[Places/Shops/Six Windows\|Six Windows]] while Beltane and Safaerys camp out in [[Places/POIs/Gwaeron's Slumber\|Gwaeron's Slumber]] in hopes to receive some prophetic dreams. 

#### Gwaeron's Slumber-(Party)
Beltane and Safaerys share information about their parents with each other, eating some pastries and sweetwater before falling asleep. In the middle of the night, Beltane is awoken and attacked by an **Oni**. Beltane barely makes it by the skin of her teeth, but she and Safaerys manage to chase off the oni, causing it to flee to the hills.
#### Six Windows
Meanwhile, Caine investigates [[Places/Shops/Six Windows\|Six Windows]] and discovers [[Characters/Tolmara Hysstryn\|Tolmara Hysstryn]] spying on him. Caine sneaks into her room after she falls asleep and lifts a key from her neck. The key unlocks the attic, and Caine finds the skeletal remains of Tolmara's husband hidden in the attic.
### The Siege of Triboar
In the morning, the Party wakes up to a large army of giants, orcs, magmen, and orogs sieging the town. The invaders are equipped with several catapults and are destroying buildings with boulders. The army is led by two fire giants, [[Characters/Okssort\|Okssort]] and [[Characters/Ildman\|Ildman]]. The Party is joined by members of the town willing to defend their land.

After the dust settles, [[Characters/Darathra Shendrel\|Darathra Shendrel]] invites the Party to the [[Places/POIs/Lord Protector's Tower\|Lord Protector's Tower]] where townsfolk offer work to the Party. [[Characters/Darathra Shendrel\|Darathra]] wishes the Party to investigate the fire giants' motives and shows the Party a large rod - known as [[Lore/Rod of Vonindod\|Rod of Vonindod]]. 

> [!example] Possible Quests
> - Pursue a wanted brigand named "Weevil". Deliver him to [[Places/Mirabar\|Mirabar]] for 5,000G

#### Gwaeron's Slumber (pt. 2)
Upon hearing Beltane's and Safaerys' encounter with the **oni**, the Party decide to pay it another visit (spoiler alert: the Oni didn't live).
#### Triboar
Back in Triboar, the Party collects a cart and horse named Boris from Narth. Safaerys also purchases her own horse. Once all's been settled in Triboar, the Party sets their sights on [[Places/Yartar\|Yartar]]. 
### Yartar
Upon arriving at [[Places/Yartar\|Yartar]], an industrial riverport, the Party receives the appropriate permit to travel through the town for the day. At nightfall, the Party camps just outside of town. 

In the morning, the Party is approached by a figure on horseback. He reveals himself to be [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]], a scholarly dragonborn studying giants. [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] is in need of an escort to the town of [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]] and wishes to further investigate troll activity in the [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]]. The Party agrees to help in escorting [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]].

Caine notices a crumbling tower to the north and the Party investigates. The tower was sealed off by a boulder and sounds of a wailing creature can be heard from within. [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] wants to call out to the creature and [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] identifies the language as Giant. [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] yells out in Giant in hopes of communication while the rest of the Party advances. Caine sends Gray to peer through the tower windows, finding a female hill giant sitting inside who begins to sing a mournful dirge. Just as [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] and [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] devise a plan to move the boulder, the female giant stops singing and shoves the boulder out of the way, ready to fight.
<< after the battle >>
As the giant breathes her last, she whispers about her husband [[Characters/Hruk\|Hruk]]. Out of sympathy, [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] revives her. Thankfully, the giant does not seem to remember the fight with the Party and her death in battle. She divulges:
> [!info] Info from Hill Giant, Moog
> - The female hill giant is named [[Characters/Moog\|Moog]]
> - Her husband, [[Characters/Hruk\|Hruk]], was forced by the tribe leader [[Guh\|Guh]] to [[Places/Grudd Haug\|Grudd Haug]]

The Part agrees to help [[Characters/Moog\|Moog]]... later. But for now, they trek on towards [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]].
### Calling Horns
What was once a small roadside inn, [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]] is now a small settlement after it was purchased and expanded upon by its owner, [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin Zoar]]. The Party heads into the original inn ([[Places/Shops/Calling Horns Inn\|Calling Horns Inn]]) and is greeted by a blonde halfling woman - but before she can even speak, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] requests an audience with [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] immediately. The halfling warns that [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] is eating dinner and does not like to be disturbed, but despite her warnings, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] will not be stopped. Eventually, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] convinces the woman to take the Party to her. Naturally, Tamalin is displeased at the intrusion but reports that there have been attacks in the outlying farms and that farmers' livestock are being killed. If the Party decide to resolve the problem, Tamalin would prefer not to pay in gold but rather write a *letter of recommendation* to either:
- A friend in [[Places/Everlund\|Everlund]], or
- The [[Lore/Factions/Hands of Yartar\|Hands of Yartar]], which Caine identifies as the Thieves' Guild

Before the sun rises, the Party is abruptly awoken by the sounds of screaming horses. Beltane dashes out of her room and heads towards the stables, wildshaping into a sabretooth tiger on the way; Caine sees from his window that something had broken through the stable walls.
<small><sub><sup>Editor's notes: pajama fun facts - Caine sleeps in Iarno's spare clothes, Beltane sleeps in her travel clothes and not her armor, Yue sleeps in silk pajamas, and Pitch sleeps in his pants.</sup></sub></small>
Equipped with the keen nose of a sabretooth tiger, Beltane catches the sent of trolls emanating from within. Rounding the corner, Beltane spots a pair of trolls beyond the broken walls and leaps into action, the rest of the Party following behind. Through their encounter, the Party learns that trolls have high regenerative capabilities, rendering them essentially immortal unless killed by fire or acid. Still, the Party emerges triumphant, bringing a semblance of peace to [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]]. [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] thanks the party for defending her town. <small><sub><sup>Editor's notes: will Tamalin reward the Party with the letter of recommendation that she promised? Find out next time!</sup></sub></small>
#### Travel Log
![TravelLog-03a.png](/img/user/z_Assets/TravelLog-03a.png)

After completing the escort of [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] to [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]], the Party decides against immediately heading into the [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]] by first stopping at [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]] to deliver their cargo. The Party also convinces [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] to tag along as well.
### Noanar's Hold
[[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]] is a small, spooky village with rattled folk and a shuttered keep that stands on a hill overlooking the village. The Party delivers the cargo to the groundskeeper of the Keep, who accepted the package but promptly shoo'd them off. Later that night, the Party heads to the [[Places/Shops/White Hart Inn\|White Hart Inn]] in search of respite from traveling. Opening the doors to the inn, they are met with a scene most peculiar - while patrons are seated at tables, chatting and dining as one would expect, a plethora of plates, glasses, mugs, and cutlery float about in the air moving throughout the inn on their own. The innkeeper catches their surprise and explain that the inn is ran with an army of permanently-summoned **Unseen Servants**. The innkeeper also warns the group from travelling at night; there are rumors of a group of undead hunters who prey on those from outside [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]]. The group also meet three noble brothers from [[Places/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] who are planning to embark on an expedition to hunt a hill giant the next morning.

Of course, as is customary in any D&D campaign, the Party does nothing with any of these obvious plot hooks and instead departs for the [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]] before dawn of the next day. 
### Evermoors
After two days' travel by foot, the Party finally reaches the edge of the [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]]. The [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]] is an area comprised of hills, troughs, chilly bogs, and swamps. There is a dense fog that permeates throughout the area and frequent gusts of wind. While the prevalent swamps usually make travelling rather difficult, [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]]' affinity and familiarity with swamplands allow the group to navigate with ease. The Party quickly found troll tracks and, in following these tracks, stumble upon the lair of a **black dragon**. Within, they discover the skeletal remains of a large dragon and an empty alcove - likely where the dragon used to stash its hoard. During their investigation, dragon eggs begin to hatch, revealing wyrmlings and locking the Party into battle! After their successful encounter with the wyrmlings, [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] and [[Caine\|Caine]] are telepathically lured towards two hidden abominations called **Otyughs**. Luckily, the group spot the ambush and defeat the horrible creatures.

Venturing deeper into the lair, the Party finds a fire giant holding what looks to be a [[Lore/Rod of Vonindod\|Rod of Vonindod]]. Accompanying the fire giant is a troll, collared and on a leash - a pet? The group tries to avoid catching the attention of the giant by using Safaerys' `Pass Without a Trace`, but they are still spotted. Despite suffering considerable damage and Caine nearly falling in battle, the Party defeats the giant and her pet troll and clutches onto victory. From the corpse of the giant, the group loots a sack of random items including a pig named [[Characters/Not Food\|Not Food]]. [[Characters/Not Food\|Not Food]] takes a liking to Caine.
### Calling Horns
Back at [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]], the Party meets with [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin Zoar]] and advises of the presence of fire giants in the [[Places/Evermoors\|Evermoors]], the [[Lore/Rod of Vonindod\|Rod of Vonindod]], and the giants' search for adamantium constructs. [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] writes them a *letter of recommendation* to her friend in Everlund, [[Characters/Dral Thelev\|Dral Thelev]] - the same person that [[Characters/Darathra Shendrel\|Darathra Shendrel]], leader of [[Places/Triboar\|Triboar]], urged the group to seek out in regards to the [[Lore/Rod of Vonindod\|Rod of Vonindod]]. 

At the tavern, they also meet [[Characters/Marthun\|Marthun]] and [[Characters/Lezryk\|Lezryk]], two of the three noble brothers who set off on a hill giant hunting expedition from [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]] several days ago. The eldest brother, [[Characters/Rantharl\|Rantharl]], is missing and when questioned by [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]], they say that [[Characters/Rantharl\|Rantharl]] was killed during their expedition. Try as the brothers might, [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]]' keen eye catches their attempts to lie. When pressed further, [[Characters/Lezryk\|Lezryk]] reveals that they had killed [[Characters/Rantharl\|Rantharl]] after he slayed the giant in order to obtain the noble family inheritance. [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] threatens to castrate them and the Party attempts to convince the brothers to sign and send a letter of confession back to [[Places/Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]]. [[Characters/Marthun\|Marthun]] agrees, but [[Characters/Lezryk\|Lezryk]] does not at all and attempts to kill his brother in a fit of rage. Thankfully, [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] senses his killing intent and stops him before he was able to land any blows. Defeatead, [[Characters/Lezryk\|Lezryk]] also agrees to sign the confession letter.

At dawn, [[Characters/Not Food\|Not Food]] is missing but the Party decides not to search for him. Next, the group heads off back to [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]] by foot. 
### Noanar's Hold
#### White Hart Inn
As the group arrives at [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]], [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] excitedly heads to the stables at [[Places/Shops/White Hart Inn\|White Hart Inn]] to check on Boris the horse. However, before arriving, she is stopped by the stableboy who explains that there had been an attack in the night. Beltane loses her temper and calls the stableboy a coward before hurrying to the stables; [[Caine\|Caine]] and [[Pitch\|Pitch]] threaten the stableboy and demand money for their horses that they'd lost.

The stable is the sight of a massacre - portions of the wall had collapsed in on several stable stalls, crushing and suffocating some horses underneath; pieces of wood, hay, and equipment strewn about as if ripped apart by a tornado. Blood splattered on nearly every surface - the walls, posts, gates, and even the roof. But most prominent, almost overpowering, of all was the unmistakable putrid stench of death. 

[[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] wildshapes to take the form of a direwolf and catches the scent of Boris leading away from the stables. Following the faint scent trail, she discovers hoofprints that go deeper into the forest. [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] catches up to her at the treeline and asks her to wait. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] verbally agrees but darts into the forest the moment [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] takes attention off her. With [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] charging ahead, following the trail of hoofprints and the Party not far behind, the group finds themselves arriving at the doors of [[Places/POIs/Huntlords' Keep\|Huntlords' Keep]].
#### Huntlords' Keep
The door to the Keep was barred from the inside and all windows were sealed shut, stopping any passerby from looking within. There is a collapsed parapet to the north which left a hole in the roof. Seeing this, [[Caine\|Caine]] directs his `Mage Hand` through the hole and opens the door from the inside. The door opens noisily and the Party proceeds slowly and cautiously, making as little noise as possible. They see a dwarf patrolling the main hall and he identifies himself as [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]]. The group follows him through the keep and eavesdrops on him speaking to several voices in the banquet hall. The Party decide to ambush the dwarf as he re-enters the main hall, successfully knocking him unconscious. They drag him to another room and attempt to interrogate him, but he boldly announces that he has forgotten fear and wishes to die - to which [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]]  responds by promptly knocking him out again. The Party decides to continue to the banquet hall and find a long room strewn with bones and five ghostly, skeletal beings seated at the main table (**wights**). One of the Party accidentally steps on a bone and - *scrrunch* - all five ghostly heads turn and lock eyes with the Party. 

< Roll initiative! It's time for battle > 

During their battle, the wights each summon skeletal horses from the bones on the ground. However, one of the horses rejects its owner upon seeing [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] and the Party. Once the wights are defeated, a visible aura lifts from the Keep, as if the land itself is breathing for the first time in centuries. 

The Party is able to identify the defiant skeletal horse as the remains of Boris! [[Caine\|Caine]] obtains a ring that allows him to summon Boris at will from his bones. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] is visibly uncomfortable with the idea of necromancy but lets it slide because she loves Boris. When the group heads back out of the banquet hall, they find that [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] the dwarf has passed, now with a peaceful smile on his face.

[[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] and [[Caine\|Caine]] head to the second floor to investigate. Going through each of the rooms reveal that the floor served as the servants' quarters. [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] finds a seal with the Huntlords' symbol on it and pockets it. Meanwhile, [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]], [[Pitch\|Pitch]], and [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] investigate the third floor and find five master suites. The Party expresses interest in taking the keep for themselves. At some point, [[Pitch\|Pitch]] notices and remarks it's a bit odd that there aren't any hunting trophies decorating the walls; [[Caine\|Caine]] suggests that there might be a basement where the trophies are kept.

Back in the room where [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] was, the group notices a statue of a man with an elk head, aiming a drawn bow and arrow towards the sky. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] confirms that the statue is not a representation of Gwaeron while [[Caine\|Caine]] takes a closer inspection. Coming closer to the statue, [[Caine\|Caine]] feels a prickly, hair-raising sensation on the back of his neck and on his fingertips. He tries to move the statue and hears a voice in his head, "*What are you doing?*"
The statue introduces himself as [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]], saying that he is the castellan (warden) of the Keep. He recognizes the Party as the new Huntlords' and masters of the Keep. He also explains that there is a basement but an offering is required to enter. As the lands are dedicated to [[Lore/Factions/Orcus\|Orcus]], these offerings are typically hunted humans. 

[[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] opens a secret trapdoor beneath his statue, revealing the passageway to the basement. Deeper into the passageway stands a statue of [[Lore/Factions/Orcus\|Orcus]], a large beastman with wings and horns, guarding a thick stone-brick door to the basement proper. A loud voice suddenly booms, demanding an offering; [[Caine\|Caine]] brings the corpse of the dwarf and places it in front of the door. With a slight rumble, the stone doors slowly slide open to a pitch-black space beyond. [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] lights the sconces in the room, revealing the space to be a crypt - one that possibly housed the original Huntlords.

Fearless, the Party enters and begins opening the tombs, hoping to find the remains of the original Huntlords. [[Caine\|Caine]] hears something moving inside one of them and opens it, finding an undead zombie leaping out at him! As he regains his footing and tries to put some distance between himself and the decaying creature, tombs all around the crypt begin opening by themselves, each carrying a zombie now defending their resting place.
< Battle time! Zombies. So many zombies. >
The Party fights through the zombie horde and survives, even if just barely. Those who are still conscious tend to each other's wounds and spend time restoring those who fell unconscious.

The booming voice threatens the Party again, but the Party ultimately decide to rest and recoup. [[Pitch\|Pitch]] had summoned a spectre in the fight against the zombie horde, and leaves the spectre as a guard over the hall. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] calls upon her druidic powers to cause moss to overgrow around the stone doors, reinforcing it to stay open. Despite the feelings of anxiousness, unease, and slight paranoia, the Party sets up camp and tries to catch some sleep. 3 hours into their rest, everyone experiences terrifying nightmares; bloody, violent, and nihilistic. When everyone has been shaken awake, they find a green hue has filled the room...
< Battle time! Zombies and skeletons > <small><sub><sup>Editor's note: No rest for the weary :( Orcus really didn't want the Party in there, huh?</sup></sub></small>
After yet another battle, the Party debates leaving the keep and returning later once they've fully recovered. [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] notifies the Party that [[Lore/Factions/Orcus\|Orcus]]' territory stretches for 10 miles, encompassing [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]]. Pitch suggests to go beyond the 10-mile reach, but [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]], [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]], and [[Caine\|Caine]] worry that [[Lore/Factions/Orcus\|Orcus]] might attach [[Places/Noanar's Hold\|Noanar's Hold]]. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] uses a charge of `Augury` from a golden statue found in [[Places/POIs/Wave Echo Cave\|Wave Echo Cave]] to see what could happen if the Party left the keep. Beltane is shown a vision of weal and woe - both good and bad. Ultimately, the Party decides to press onward.

Heading deeper into the basement passageway and beyond the crypt, the group sees a tall room with a large pit in the middle. The pit is filled two-feet deep worth of various bones, undoubtedly the "trophies" from the Lord's ([[Lore/Factions/Orcus\|Orcus]]) hunts. Amongst the bones, four sets of marble stairs emerge, all leading to a raised platform in the center of the pit. On the platform is a lit altar with a glowing effigy and a giant skeleton strapped down with chains. [[Pitch\|Pitch]] heads into the room first, with Beltane in elk-form (Elktane) following closely behind. The moment the Party sets foot in the room, the sounds of rattling chains and tumbling bones echo throughout the chamber.  Looking up at the altar, the Party finds themselves meeting the hollow gaze of a giant skeleton. 
< Battle time! Giant Skeleton and smaller, regular skeletons >
[[Pitch\|Pitch]] and [[Caine\|Caine]] are grabbed by skeletal hands that reach from the floor, but [[Pitch\|Pitch]] casts `Misty Step` and lands on Elktane's back. After a moment, [[Caine\|Caine]] was able to break free of the skeletal hands and makes his way to the altar. Elktane and [[Characters/Players/Safaerys\|Safaerys]] land the killing blows on the **Giant Skeleton**. [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] forgets that [[Pitch\|Pitch]] is on her back and shifts back to her tiefling form, falling down with [[Pitch\|Pitch]] on top of her.
The voice of [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] is heard emanating from [[Caine\|Caine]]. When the Party questions him, he says it's a new magic that he learned; [[Characters/Players/Beltane\|Beltane]] catches his lie but doesn't call him out on it. Eventually, [[Caine\|Caine]] shows everyone a lantern that he found at the altar. It glows with a blue light and is identified as a `Ghost Lantern`. [[Amaranth\|Amaranth]] can inhabit both the Keep and the lantern, allowing the Party to communicate with him even when they are not physically at the Keep.
