### Giant Castle on a Cloud

[[Characters/Zephyros\|Zephyros]] speaks of a prophecy of destruction and chaos, the Party agrees to travel to [[Places/Triboar\|Triboar]] on the Castle Cloud. The Party also obtains some information about Giants and their societal system:

> Giants follow a hierarchical system, in descending order:
> 1. Annam, the All-Father (a god)

> - The last great giant empire was Ostoria

### Triboar
The Party arrives in [[Places/Triboar\|Triboar]], a large bustling mercantile town. Beltane notes of an untouched forest outside of town named [[Places/POIs/Gwaeron's Slumber\|Gwaeron's Slumber]]. It is said that worshippers of Gwaeron, God of Tracking, or Mieliki, Goddess of the Forest, would receive prophetic dreams if they slept there. For the night, [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] , Pitch, and Caine head to [[Places/Shops/Six Windows\|Six Windows]] while Beltane and Safaerys camp out in [[Places/POIs/Gwaeron's Slumber\|Gwaeron's Slumber]] in hopes to receive some prophetic dreams. 

#### Gwaeron's Slumber-(Party)
Beltane and Safaerys share information about their parents with each other, eating some pastries and sweetwater before falling asleep. In the middle of the night, Beltane is awoken and attacked by an **Oni**. Beltane barely makes it by the skin of her teeth, but she and Safaerys manage to chase off the oni, causing it to flee to the hills.
#### Six Windows
Meanwhile, Caine investigates [[Places/Shops/Six Windows\|Six Windows]] and discovers [[Characters/Tolmara Hysstryn\|Tolmara Hysstryn]] spying on him. Caine sneaks into her room after she falls asleep and lifts a key from her neck. The key unlocks the attic, and Caine finds the skeletal remains of Tolmara's husband hidden in the attic.
### The Siege of Triboar
In the morning, the Party wakes up to a large army of giants, orcs, magmen, and orogs sieging the town. The invaders are equipped with several catapults and are destroying buildings with boulders. The army is led by two fire giants, [[Characters/Okssort\|Okssort]] and [[Characters/Ildman\|Ildman]]. The Party is joined by members of the town willing to defend their land.

After the dust settles, [[Characters/Darathra Shendrel\|Darathra Shendrel]] invites the Party to the [[Places/POIs/Lord Protector's Tower\|Lord Protector's Tower]] where townsfolk offer work to the Party. [[Characters/Darathra Shendrel\|Darathra]] wishes the Party to investigate the fire giants' motives and shows the Party a large rod - known as [[Lore/Rod of Vonindod\|Rod of Vonindod]].

#### Gwaeron's Slumber (pt. 2)
Upon hearing Beltane's and Safaerys' encounter with the **oni**, the Party decide to pay it another visit (spoiler alert: the Oni didn't live).
#### Triboar
Back in Triboar, the Party collects a cart and horse named Boris from Narth. Safaerys also purchases her own horse. Once all's been settled in Triboar, the Party sets their sights on [[Places/Yartar\|Yartar]]. 
### Yartar
Upon arriving at [[Places/Yartar\|Yartar]], an industrial riverport, the Party receives the appropriate permit to travel through the town for the day. At nightfall, the Party camps just outside of town. 

In the morning, the Party is approached by a figure on horseback. He reveals himself to be [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]], a scholarly dragonborn studying giants. [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] is in need of an escort to the town of [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]] and wishes to further investigate troll activity in the Evermoors. The Party agrees to help in escorting [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]].

Caine notices a crumbling tower to the north and the Party investigates. The tower was sealed off by a boulder and sounds of a wailing creature can be heard from within. [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] wants to call out to the creature and [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] identifies the language as Giant. [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] yells out in Giant in hopes of communication while the rest of the Party advances. Caine sends Gray to peer through the tower windows, finding a female hill giant sitting inside who begins to sing a mournful dirge. Just as [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] and [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] devise a plan to move the boulder, the female giant stops singing and shoves the boulder out of the way, ready to fight.
<< after the battle >>
As the giant breathes her last, she whispers about her husband [[Characters/Hruk\|Hruk]]. Out of sympathy, [[Characters/Players/Yue\|Yue]] revives her. Thankfully, the giant does not seem to remember the fight with the Party and her death in battle. She divulges:
> [!info] Info from Hill Giant, Moog
> - The female hill giant is named [[Characters/Moog\|Moog]]
> - Her husband, [[Characters/Hruk\|Hruk]], was forced by the tribe leader [[Guh\|Guh]] to [[Places/Grudd Haug\|Grudd Haug]]

The Part agrees to help [[Characters/Moog\|Moog]]... later. But for now, they trek on towards [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]].
### Calling Horns
What was once a small roadside inn, [[Places/Calling Horns\|Calling Horns]] is now a small settlement after it was purchased and expanded upon by its owner, [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin Zoar]]. The Party heads into the original inn ([[Places/Shops/Calling Horns Inn\|Calling Horns Inn]]) and is greeted by a blonde halfing woman - but before she can even speak, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] requests an audience with [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] immediately. The halfling warns that [[Characters/Tamalin Zoar\|Tamalin]] is eating dinner and does not like to be disturbed, but despite her warnings, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] will not be stopped. Eventually, [[Characters/Udomorn\|Udomorn]] convinces the woman to take the Party to her. Naturally, Tamalin is unpleased at the intrusion but reports that there have been attacks in the outlying farms and that farmers' livestock are being killed. Tamalin would prefer not to pay in gold, but rather write a *letter of recommendation* to either:
- A friend in Everlund, or
- The [[Lore/Factions/Hands of Yartar\|Hands of Yartar]], whom Caine identifies as the Thieves' Guild

Before the sun rises, the Party is awoken by the sounds of horses screaming. Beltane runs out of her room to the stables; Caine sees from his window that something had broken through the walls of the stable.
<small><sup>Editor's notes - pajama fun facts: Caine sleeps in Iarno's spare clothes, Beltane sleeps in her travel clothes and not her armor, Yue sleeps in silk pajamas, and Pitch sleeps in his pants.</sup></small>
